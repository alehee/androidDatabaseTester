</p>

To **check your database connection** simply take these steps:
1. Fill the **IP**, **User**, **Password**, **Database** textboxes with your database connection data
2. Hit that *TEST MYSQL CONNECTION* button and wait for response on the screen

If you want to **execute some SELECT query** you should do it that way:
1. Fill the **IP**, **User**, **Password**, **Database**, **SELECT query** textboxes with your database connection data and specific SELECT query string
2. Click *TEST MYSQL QUERY* and wait for the response
3. If the response is green you can scroll down to view your query result

And that's it! You can run simple queries or test if your database is online always from your pocket!
